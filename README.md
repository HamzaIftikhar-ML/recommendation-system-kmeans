# Recommendation System using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Introduction
This project implements a recommendation system using **K-Means clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm.
The goal is to group similar users or items and generate recommendations based on cluster similarity.

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
- K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
- Euclidean distance for similarity measurement

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 🔄 Project Workflow
1. Load dataset
2. Data preprocessing
3. Feature scaling
4. Apply K-Means clustering
5. Analyze clusters
6. Generate recommendations

## 📊 Output
Users/items are grouped into clusters, and recommendations are made by selecting similar items from the same cluster.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Collaborative filtering
- Hybrid recommendation system
- Performance evaluation metrics
